# Rust by example

Examples based on the official Rust documentation with some modifications and/or additions. It's not a tutorial, I just created the repository for the purpose of studying the language.

The `get-started` directory contains only the main essentials for getting familiar with the language.

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sirius-beck/rust-by-example.git

cd get-started && cargo run
# or
cd examples/{example_name} && cargo run
```
